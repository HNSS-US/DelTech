![alt text](http://www.stroustrup.com/xBjarne2018.jpg.pagespeed.ic.OKK5_X_jLu.webp "Bjarne Stroustrup")  

1. Since Bjarne Stroustrup is the designer and implementor of C++. His [homepage](http://www.stroustrup.com/ "Bjarne Stroustrup's homepage"), is well worth the vist.  

Here is a breif video on why C++ was created:

#### Resources for learning C++
1. For the serious-minded person, [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/ "cplusplus homepage") is a great resource for all things C++.  It has a great community and it is worth creating an account on the site. By the way, it takes less than two minutes to read their User Agreement.

2. When you are in the "Git 'Er Done" mindset. There is [tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm "tutorialspoint.com"). A lot of code with the ability to test it from the site.

3. New site [thispointer.com](https://thispointer.com/c11-tutorial/ "thispointer.com") looks interesting.

4. C++ Core [Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#S-abstra): This is a set of core guidelines for modern C++ (currently C++17) taking likely future enhancements and ISO Technical Specifications (TSs) into account. The aim is to help C++ programmers to write simpler, more efficient, more maintainable code.
