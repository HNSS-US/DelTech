## Track work for CSC114 courses at DelTech  
### IDE for CSC114  
I am about to write something that I never thought I would never write. Not in my lifetime or in the N^(N+1) lifetimes of my children. Here goes, I just installed a Microsoft Product on my Linux computer with the following commands:

$ sudo apt-get update  
$ sudo apt-get upgrade $ sudo apt-get install snapd  
$ sudo snap install code --classic  
$ sudo apt-get update  
$ sudo apt-get upgrade  

(The multiple update and upgrade are my habit.)

To uninstall: $ sudo snap remove code

Also, depending on your distro and version, it could be available in the Software Center.

As amazing as the installation experience was, what is more, amazing is that I love using this application. All I can say is good riddance to Bill Gates! And may he and his kind never return to the world of computers.

#### Historical Resources for C++

1. Since Bjarne Stroustrup is the designer and implementor of C++. His [homepage](http://www.stroustrup.com/ "Bjarne Stroustrup's homepage"), is well worth the vist.  

Here is a breif video on why C++ was created:

#### Resources for learning C++

1. For the serious-minded person, [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/ "cplusplus homepage") is a great resource for all things C++.  It has a great community and it is worth creating an account on the site. By the way, it takes less than two minutes to read their User Agreement.

2. When you are in the "Git 'Er Done" mindset. There is [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/ "w3schools.com"). A lot of code with the ability to test it from the site, however, the site is very short on explanations.
