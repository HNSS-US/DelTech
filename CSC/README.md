#### Links  
0. Standard C++ Foundation [Get Started](https://isocpp.org/get-started)  
1. C++ Core [Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#S-abstra): This is a set of core guidelines for modern C++ (currently C++17) taking likely future enhancements and ISO Technical Specifications (TSs) into account. The aim is to help C++ programmers to write simpler, more efficient, more maintainable code.  
2. C++ consortium(?), [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/ "cplusplus homepage") is a great resource for all things C++.  It has a great community and it is worth creating an account on the site. By the way, it takes less than two minutes to read their User Agreement.  
3. At thispointer.com, there are many higher level code  [examples](https://thispointer.com/c11-tutorial/ "thispointer.com")  sans explantations.  
4. When you are in the "Git 'Er Done" mindset. There is [tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm "tutorialspoint.com"). A lot of code with the ability to test it from the site.   

#### To Investigate
##### Data Input Validation

### CSC114
#### IDE for CSC114  
[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/HNSS-US/IDEs/tree/master/Visual-Studio-Code)  

### Textbook for CSC114  
STARTING OUT WITH C++ From Control Structures through Objects NINTH EDITION By Tony Gaddis of Haywood Community College  

#### Historical Resources for C++
![alt text](http://www.stroustrup.com/xBjarne2018.jpg.pagespeed.ic.OKK5_X_jLu.webp "Bjarne Stroustrup")  

1. Since Bjarne Stroustrup is the designer and implementor of C++. His [homepage](http://www.stroustrup.com/ "Bjarne Stroustrup's homepage"), is well worth the vist.  

Here is a breif video on why C++ was created:

#### Resources for learning C++
1. For the serious-minded person, [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/ "cplusplus homepage") is a great resource for all things C++.  It has a great community and it is worth creating an account on the site. By the way, it takes less than two minutes to read their User Agreement.

2. When you are in the "Git 'Er Done" mindset. There is [tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm "tutorialspoint.com"). A lot of code with the ability to test it from the site.

3. New site [thispointer.com](https://thispointer.com/c11-tutorial/ "thispointer.com") looks interesting.

4. C++ Core [Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#S-abstra): This is a set of core guidelines for modern C++ (currently C++17) taking likely future enhancements and ISO Technical Specifications (TSs) into account.
